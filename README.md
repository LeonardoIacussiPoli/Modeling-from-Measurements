# Modeling from Measurements course project

## Abstract
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning algorithms are in-
creasingly being used given the growing availability of real data
and computing power. Most of the developed algorithms deal
with image and audio recognition, but interest in such algorithms
is also expanding for solving purely engineering problems usu-
ally concerning systems of differential and partial differential
equations. In this project, several recent regression methods are
discussed: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DmD), SINDy mod-
els, Neural Network to model and predict the dynamic of some
historical problems such as Predator-Prey model, the Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky equations and Lorenz equations and compare the
results with well defined solutions.
